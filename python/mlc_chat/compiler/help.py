1) Path to a HuggingFace model directory that contains a `config.json` or
2) Path to `config.json` in HuggingFace format, or
3) The name of a pre-defined model architecture.

A `config.json` file in HuggingFace format defines the model architecture, including the vocabulary
size, the number of layers, the hidden size, number of attention heads, etc.
Example: https://huggingface.co/codellama/CodeLlama-7b-hf/blob/main/config.json.

A HuggingFace directory often contains a `config.json` which defines the model architecture,
the non-quantized model weights in PyTorch or SafeTensor format, tokenizer configurations,
as well as an optional `generation_config.json` provides additional default configuration for
text generation.
Example: https://huggingface.co/codellama/CodeLlama-7b-hf/tree/main.

Quantization format.

Model architecture such as "llama". If not set, it is inferred from `config.json`.

The GPU device to compile the model to. If not set, it is inferred from GPUs available locally.

The device used to do quantization such as "cuda" or "cuda:0". Will detect from local available GPUs

The host LLVM triple to compile the model to. If not set, it is inferred from the local CPU and OS.
Examples of the LLVM triple:
1) iPhones: arm64-apple-ios;
2) ARM64 Android phones: aarch64-linux-android;
3) WebAssembly: wasm32-unknown-unknown-wasm;
4) Windows: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc;
5) ARM macOS: arm64-apple-darwin.
""".strip(),
    "opt": """
Optimization flags. MLC LLM maintains a predefined set of optimization flags,
denoted as O0, O1, O2, O3, where O0 means no optimization, O2 means majority of them,
and O3 represents extreme optimization that could potentially break the system.
Meanwhile, optimization flags could be explicitly specified via details knobs, e.g.
--opt="cutlass_attn=1;cutlass_norm=0;cublas_gemm=0;cudagraph=0".
""".strip(),
    "prefix_symbols": """
Adding a prefix to all symbols exported. Similar to "objcopy --prefix-symbols".
This is useful when compiling multiple models into a single library to avoid symbol
conflicts. Differet from objcopy, this takes no effect for shared library.
""".strip(),
    "context_window_size": """
Option to provide the maximum sequence length supported by the model.
This is usually explictly shown as context length or context window in the model card.
If this option is not set explicitly, by default, 
it will be determined by `context_window_size` or `max_position_embeddings` in `config.json`,
and the latter is usually inaccurate for some models.
""".strip(),
    "output_compile": """
The name of the output file. The suffix determines if the output file is a shared library or
objects. Available suffixes:
1) Linux: .so (shared), .tar (objects);
2) macOS: .dylib (shared), .tar (objects);
3) Windows: .dll (shared), .tar (objects);
4) Android, iOS: .tar (objects);
5) Web: .wasm (web assembly).
