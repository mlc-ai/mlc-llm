## Overview

**M**achine **L**earning **C**ompilation for **L**arge **L**anguage **M**odels (MLC LLM) is a high-performance universal deployment solution that allows native deployment of any large language models with native APIs with compiler acceleration. The mission of this project is to enable everyone to develop, optimize and deploy AI models natively on everyone's devices with ML compilation techniques.

## Installation

MLC LLM is available via [pip](https://llm.mlc.ai/docs/install/mlc_llm.html#install-mlc-packages).
It is always recommended to install it in an isolated conda virtual environment.

To verify the installation, activate your virtual environment, run

```bash
python -c "import mlc_llm; print(mlc_llm.__path__)"
```

You are expected to see the installation path of MLC LLM Python package.
