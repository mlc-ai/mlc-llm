# MLC-LLM TVM v0.22 Upgrade Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

**Mission Statement**: Upgrade MLC-LLM to use TVM v0.22 for both Python and C++ dependencies to enable Gemma-3-270m model compilation with sliding window transformers and 4-bit quantization support.

**Current State Analysis**:
- MLC-LLM currently uses a custom TVM fork with version mismatch: C++ v0.21.dev0 vs Python v0.22.dev0
- This mismatch causes FFI object registration failures and prevents proper functionality
- Previous upgrade attempts have failed due to underestimating scope and complexity

**Critical Issues Identified**:
1. **Version Mismatch**: C++ and Python TVM versions must match exactly
2. **DLPack Type System**: DLTensor → DLNDArray migration required
3. **FFI Macro Changes**: Object registration and management APIs changed
4. **Const Correctness**: TVM v0.22 generates const operators but MLC-LLM needs mutable objects
5. **Build System Fragility**: Small changes can break entire build system

**Success Criteria**:
- Complete TVM v0.22 upgrade in MLC-LLM
- Gemma-3-270m model compilation working
- 4-bit quantization functional
- Sliding window transformers working
- WebLLM integration complete

## Key Challenges and Analysis

**Technical Complexity**: This upgrade affects every aspect of the system simultaneously - DLPack types, FFI macros, const correctness, and build systems are all interconnected.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **High Risk**: Const correctness issues require architectural changes, not just surface fixes
- **Medium Risk**: Build system fragility can mask real issues and complicate debugging
- **High Risk**: Lack of TVM expertise may require external assistance

**Scope Underestimation**: Previous attempts failed because the upgrade affects thousands of lines across hundreds of files, not just isolated components.

**Counterpoints and Alternatives**:
- **Alternative 1**: Stay with TVM v0.21 and wait for official MLC-LLM v0.22 support
- **Alternative 2**: Use working TVM commit `045eb5bc9` as starting point
- **Alternative 3**: Focus on smaller scope first (TVM v0.22 only), tackle const correctness separately

## High-Level Task Breakdown

### Phase 0: Preparation & Environment Setup (Priority: Critical)
**T**: Set up clean development environment and verify baseline functionality
**C**: Current MLC-LLM codebase with TVM v0.21, need to establish working baseline before upgrade

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

**Status**: Phase 1 COMPLETED - Basic TVM Integration ✓ | Phase 2 REQUIRED - Model Compilation Fails
**Current Phase**: Phase 1 - TVM Submodule Upgrade (COMPLETED) | Phase 2 - DLPack Migration (CRITICAL)
**Current Blocker**: Segfault during model compilation - DLPack type system incompatibility
**Last Updated**: $(date)

### Current Findings:
**PHASE 1 SUCCESS**: Basic TVM Integration Complete ✅

- **Bitwise Hypothesis**: Missing bitwise operators using powers of 2 for efficient sliding window mask computation
- **Impact**: Cannot generate TIR code for sliding window attention mechanisms
- **Solution**: Implement missing TIR operations for sliding window attention
- **Status**: BLOCKED - requires TIR operation implementation/fixes

**Technical Resolution Summary**:

## Agent's Feedback & Assistance Requests

**Phase 1 Successfully Completed**:
- ✅ TVM v0.22 basic integration fully operational in virtual environment
- ✅ All FFI object registration issues resolved
- ✅ Clean environment established for Phase 2 work

**CRITICAL: Phase 2 Required Immediately**:
- ❌ Model compilation segfaults - DLPack migration essential
- ❌ Gemma-3-270M conversion fails during convert_weight
- ❌ Tensor operations incompatible with TVM v0.22 DLPack changes
- 🔴 **BLOCKER**: Cannot proceed without Phase 2 completion

**Immediate Next Steps**:
- Phase 2.1: Find all DLPack type usage across codebase (CRITICAL)
- Phase 2.2-2.4: Systematically migrate DLTensor → DLNDArray types
- Target: Fix segfault and enable successful model compilation

**Technical Validation**:
- TVM v0.22 basic imports work (Phase 1 success criteria met)
- MLC-LLM CLI functional with TVM v0.22 backend
- Virtual environment provides clean isolation
- **BUT**: Model compilation requires Phase 2 DLPack migration

## Lessons

**From Phase 1 Completion**:
- Virtual environment isolation is critical for complex multi-dependency projects
- TVM Python package must be installed separately when using submodule builds
- Script printer optional imports prevent hard failures in incomplete builds
- Systematic debugging + expert-level fixes can resolve complex FFI issues
- Clean environment validation is essential before declaring success

**From refactor.md Analysis**:
- Version mismatch between C++ and Python TVM is root cause of previous failures
- Const correctness represents fundamental architectural change, not surface issue
- Build system fragility requires systematic, phased approach
- Scope was severely underestimated in previous attempts
- Expert TVM knowledge may be required for successful completion

**Planning Insights**:
- TCREI framework provides good structure for complex multi-phase upgrade
- Need to balance technical requirements with risk mitigation
- Success depends on systematic approach with comprehensive testing
- Always test imports before declaring victory, especially in complex FFI systems
