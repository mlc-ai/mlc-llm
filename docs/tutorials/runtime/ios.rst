We will use ``vicuna-v1-7b`` as an example to demonstrate the
quantization and cross-compilation workflow for LLM on iOS devices. The
same procedure can be applied to other models as well, such as Dolly and
RedPajama.

Step 1. Install TVM Unity
-------------------------

Please follow :doc:`/install/tvm` to install TVM Unity.

Step 2. Download LLM weights
----------------------------

Download the LLM weights for Vicuna-7b by following the instructions
from `LMSys <https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat#vicuna-weights>`__.
Place the downloaded weights under the ``./dist/models/vicuna-v1-7b``
directory within the ``mlc-llm`` folder. The contents of the folder
should include the following files:

.. code:: bash

   >>> ls ./dist/models/vicuna-v1-7b
   config.json
   pytorch_model.bin.index.json
   pytorch_model-00001-of-00002.bin
   pytorch_model-00002-of-00002.bin
   tokenizer.model
   tokenizer_config.json
   special_tokens_map.json

Step 3. Quantize and cross-compile LLMs with TVM Unity
------------------------------------------------------

To quantize and cross-compile the LLMs to iPhone/iPad targets, use the
provided ``build.py`` script:

.. code:: bash


   python3 build.py                    \
       --model /path/to/vicuna-v1-7b   \ 
       --quantization q3f16_0          \
       --target iphone                 \
       --max-seq-len 768

   # If the model path is `./dist/models/vicuna-v1-7b`,
   # we can simplify the build command to
   python3 build.py            \
       --model vicuna-v1-7b    \
       --quantization q3f16_0  \
       --target iphone         \
       --max-seq-len 768

By default, the compiled artifact will be located under
``./dist/vicuna-v1-7b-q3f16_0``. The folder includes: - The static
library for LLM computation: ``vicuna-v1-7b-q3f16_0-iphone.a`` - Assets,
including weight shards under ``params/`` - Tokenizer metadata

Step 4. Build auxiliary components
----------------------------------

**Tokenizer and runtime**

In addition to the model itself, a lightweight runtime and tokenizer are
required to actually run the LLM. You can build and organize these
components by following these steps:

.. code:: bash

   cd ./ios
   vim ./prepare_libs.sh # Update MODEL, QUANTIZATION, and other variables
   ./prepare_libs.sh

This will create a ``./build`` folder that contains the following files:

.. code:: bash

   >>> ls ./build/lib/
   libmlc_llm.a         # The lightweight interface to interact with LLM, tokenizer, and TVM Unity runtime
   libmodel_iphone.a    # The compiled LLM
   libsentencepiece.a   # SentencePiece tokenizer
   libtokenizers_cpp.a  # Huggingface tokenizer
   libtvm_runtime.a     # TVM Unity runtime

**Collect assets**

To organize the assets, execute the following script within the
``./ios`` directory:

.. code:: bash

   cd ./ios
   vim ./prepare_params.sh # Update MODEL, QUANTIZATION, TOKENIZER, and other variables
   ./prepare_params.sh

The outcome should be as follows:

.. code:: bash

   >>> ls ./dist/
   params/              # Parameter shards
   tokenizer.json       # Tokenizer metadata

Step 5. Build iOS App
---------------------

Open ``./ios/MLCChat.xcodeproj`` using Xcode. Note that you will need an
Apple Developer Account to use Xcode, and you may be prompted to use
your own developer team credential and product bundle identifier.

To use a specific model, edit ``./ios/MLCChat/LLMChat.mm`` to configure
the following settings properly:

1. Model name using the ``model`` variable
2. Conversation template using the ``conv_template`` variable
3. Tokenizer name using the ``tokenizer_path`` variable
4. Other settings including max sequence length, temperature, etc.

Ensure that all the necessary dependencies and configurations are
correctly set up in the Xcode project.

Once you have made the necessary changes, build the iOS app using Xcode.
Make sure to select a target device or simulator for the build.

After a successful build, you can run the iOS app on your device or
simulator to use the LLM model for text generation and processing.
