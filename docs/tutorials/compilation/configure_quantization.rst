Quantization Algorithm
----------------------

The default quantization algorithm used in MLC-LLM is grouping quantization method discussed in the papers `The case for 4-bit precision: k-bit Inference Scaling Laws <https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09720>`__ and `LUT-GEMM: Quantized Matrix Multiplication based on LUTs for Efficient Inference in Large-Scale Generative Language Models <https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09557>`__.

ðŸš§ Quantization Mode (Not Stable)
---------------------------------

In MLC-LLM we use a short code that indicates the quantization mode to use.

The format of the code is ``qAfB(_id)``, where ``A`` represents the number
of bits for storing weights and ``B`` represents the number of bits for storing activations. The ``_id`` is an integer identifier to distinguish different quantization algorithms (e.g. symmetric, non-symmetric, GPTQ, etc).

Currently, the available options are: ``q3f16_0``, ``q4f16_0``, ``q4f32_0``, ``q0f32``, ``q0f16``, and ``q8f16_0``. The default value is ``q3f16_0``.
