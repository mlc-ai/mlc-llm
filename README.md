MLC LLM compiles and runs code on MLCEngine -- a unified high-performance LLM inference engine across the above platforms. MLCEngine provides OpenAI-compatible API available through REST server, python, javascript, iOS, Android, all backed by the same engine and compiler that we keep improving with the community.
