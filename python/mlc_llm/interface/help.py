1) Path to a HuggingFace model directory that contains a `config.json` or
2) Path to `config.json` in HuggingFace format, or
3) The name of a pre-defined model architecture.

A `config.json` file in HuggingFace format defines the model architecture, including the vocabulary
size, the number of layers, the hidden size, number of attention heads, etc.
Example: https://huggingface.co/codellama/CodeLlama-7b-hf/blob/main/config.json.

A HuggingFace directory often contains a `config.json` which defines the model architecture,
the non-quantized model weights in PyTorch or SafeTensor format, tokenizer configurations,
as well as an optional `generation_config.json` provides additional default configuration for
text generation.
Example: https://huggingface.co/codellama/CodeLlama-7b-hf/tree/main.

""".strip(),
    "mode_serve": """
The engine mode in MLC LLM. We provide three preset modes: "local", "interactive" and "server".
The default mode is "local".
The choice of mode decides the values of "max_num_sequence", "max_total_seq_length" and
"prefill_chunk_size" when they are not explicitly specified.
1. Mode "local" refers to the local server deployment which has low request concurrency.
   So the max batch size will be set to 4, and max total sequence length and prefill chunk size
   are set to the context window size (or sliding window size) of the model.
2. Mode "interactive" refers to the interactive use of server, which has at most 1 concurrent
   request. So the max batch size will be set to 1, and max total sequence length and prefill
   chunk size are set to the context window size (or sliding window size) of the model.
3. Mode "server" refers to the large server use case which may handle many concurrent request
   and want to use GPU memory as much as possible. In this mode, we will automatically infer
   the largest possible max batch size and max total sequence length.
You can manually specify arguments "max_num_sequence", "max_total_seq_length" and
"prefill_chunk_size" via "--overrides" to override the automatic inferred values.
For example: --overrides "max_num_sequence=32;max_total_seq_length=4096"
