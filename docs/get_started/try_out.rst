================

Welcome to MLC LLM. To get started, we have prepared prebuilt packages
for you to try out MLC Chat app built with MLC LLM,
and you can try out prebuilt models on the following platforms:

.. tabs::

  .. tab:: CLI (Linux/MacOS/Windows)

    **MLC LLM now supports Llama-2.** *Follow the instructions below and try out the CLI!*

    To run the models on your PC, you can try out the CLI version of MLC LLM.

    We have prepared Conda packages for MLC Chat CLI. If you haven't installed Conda yet,
    please refer to :doc:`this tutorial </install/conda>` to install Conda.

    .. code:: bash

      # Create a new conda environment, install CLI app, and activate the environment.
      conda create -n mlc-chat-venv -c mlc-ai -c conda-forge mlc-chat-cli-nightly
      conda activate mlc-chat-venv

      # Install Git and Git-LFS if you haven't already.
      # They are used for downloading the model weights from HuggingFace.
      conda install git git-lfs
      git lfs install

      # Create a directory, download the model weights from HuggingFace, and download the binary libraries
      # from GitHub.
      mkdir -p dist/prebuilt
      git clone https://github.com/mlc-ai/binary-mlc-llm-libs.git dist/prebuilt/lib

      # Download prebuilt weights of Llama-2-7B
      cd dist/prebuilt
      git clone https://huggingface.co/mlc-ai/mlc-chat-Llama-2-7b-chat-hf-q4f16_1
      cd ../..
      mlc_chat_cli --local-id Llama-2-7b-chat-hf-q4f16_1

      # You can try more models, for example:
      # download prebuilt weights of RedPajama-3B
      cd dist/prebuilt
      git clone https://huggingface.co/mlc-ai/mlc-chat-RedPajama-INCITE-Chat-3B-v1-q4f16_0

      MLC LLM on CLI

  .. tab:: Web Browser

    With the advancements of WebGPU, we can now run LLM completely in the web browser environment.
    You can try out the web version of MLC LLM in `WebLLM <https://webllm.mlc.ai/#chat-demo>`__.

    In WebLLM, once the model weights are fetched and stored in the local cache in the first run, you can start to interact with the model without Internet connection.

    A WebGPU-compatible browser and a local GPU are needed to run WebLLM. You can download the latest Google Chrome and use `WebGPU Report <https://webgpureport.org/>`__ to verify the functionality of WebGPU on your browser.
